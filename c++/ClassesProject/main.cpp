#include <iostream>
// Write a C++ program that demonstrates a class named Dice.
// It will use the random number generator to simulate rolling a 6-sided Die 100 times, 
// while counting how many times each number of the die comes up.
//
// Example output:
// The number 1 was rolled 23 times
// The number 2 was rolled 15 times

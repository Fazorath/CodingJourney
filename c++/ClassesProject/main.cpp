// Using OOP, write a C++ program that will indicate the number of days in a month where the temperature was above average, 
// below average, and at the average for the month of November.  
// Using an array to count the number of days above average, below average, and at average, 
// read in an input file named NovTemps.txt that gives the temperature for each day of the month.  
// The input file should be located in the current directory.  
// If the temperature is above the average temperature, 
// increment the counter in the array that holds the count for the days above average.  
// If the temperature is below the average temperature, increment the counter in the array that holds the count 
// for the days below average.  If the temperature is equal to the average temperature, increment the counter in 
// the array that holds the count for the days equal to the average.

// When the end of file has been reached, display the count for the number of days above average, below average, and equal to the average.

// Be sure to place variables within the private accessor area of the class.  
// Use a constructor to initialize the array elements to 0.  No global variables are allowed.  
// A submission of all code in main() will result in a grade of 0.
